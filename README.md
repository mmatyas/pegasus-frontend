## Features

**Open source and cross platform:** runs on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, all Raspberries, Odroids and possibly on other devices too. Hardware accelerated and works with or without X11.

**Full control over the UI:** themes can completely change everything that is on the screen. Add or remove UI elements, menu screens, animations, whatever. Want to make it look like Kodi? Steam? Any other launcher? No problem. You can even [run your custom shader code](etc/promo/shader_demo.jpg).

**ES2 backward compatibility:** Pegasus can use EmulationStation's gamelist files, no need to invent a new set of tools.

**Features you'd expect:** Gamepad support and config. Multiple aspect ratio support. Portable mode support. Live theme reload. A clock in the corner.


## Installation and setup

You can find downloads and platform-specific notes on the [project's website](http://pegasus-frontend.org), under *Downloads*. Documentation and configuration guides can be found [HERE](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/), in particular you might want to take a look on the [Getting started](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started/) page.


## Building from source

**Build dependencies**

- C++11 compatible compiler
- Qt 5.15.0 or later, with the following modules:
    - QML and QtQuick2
    - Multimedia
    - SVG
    - SQL (SQLite v3)
- Either SDL (2.0.4 or later) or Qt Gamepad

For more information, please see the detailed [build guide](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/dev/build).

**Downloading the source**

The project uses Git submodules. If you've cloned the repository recursively, they are automatically cloned as well. In case you forgot to do that, you can do it manually, like this:

```sh
# call this after every repo update
git submodule update --init
```

**Building**

You can use any Qt-compatible IDEs, eg. Qt Creator to build the project, or you can manually invoke:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
qmake ..  # qmake [params] [project path], see below
make
make check    # optional, to run tests
make install  # optional
```

**For more details**, including possible build parameters, see the [build documentation](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/dev/build).
